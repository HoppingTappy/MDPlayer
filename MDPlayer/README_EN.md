  If you select .TFI / .DMP / .OPNI, it outputs to a file instead of the clipboard.  
  
  Although it is not as good as it could be, it is possible to output the performance data of YM2612 and YM2151 as a MIDI file.  
  If VOPMex is used, it is possible to reflect the voice information of the FM sound source.  
  (VOPMex, not VOPM. ;-P )  
  
  PCM data can be dumped, but only SEGAPCM outputs in WAV.  
  
  It is possible to export the performance as wav.  
  
  VSTi can be specified as MIDI sound source.  

  Playback, stop, and other operations can be performed from the keyboard or MIDI keyboard.  
  
  Files with the same name (Text, MML, Image) with different extensions can be opened from the playlist.

  When a file is specified at startup from the command line, it is read in and played back.  
    Normally, the specified file is added to the playlist, but if the "-PL-" option is specified, the file is not added.  
      Example)
        MDPlayerx64.exe sample.vgm  
          Load sample.vgm at startup and start playback. Add it to the playlist.
        MDPlayerx64.exe -PL- sample.vgm
          Load sample.vgm at startup and start playback. However, it is not added to the playlist.

[Slightly confusing operation]  
  Double-clicking (toggling) the title bar of each window will always bring it to the front.  
　The function has been added so that the window position can be initialized by starting the application while holding down the Shift key.  

  
  
[A little confusing setting item].  
  Options] window > [other] tab > [Search paths on additional file].  
    Enter paths in this text box,  
    If you enter a path in this text box, additional files that are referenced when playing back song data will be searched in that location.  
    Multiple paths can be enumerated with a ; delimiter.  
    Additional files to be searched for each driver are as follows  
      Recomposer (.RCP)  
        .CM6 / .GSD  
      MoonDriver(.MDR)  
        .PCM  
      MXDRV(.MDX)  
        .PDX  
      MNDRV(.MND)  
        .PND  
    In the case of PMDDotNET, the path specified by the PMD environment variable is referenced.  

  
  
[G.I.M.I.C. related information].  
  About SSG volume  
    SSG volume can be adjusted using the "G.OPN" and "G.OPNA" faders at the bottom right of the mixer screen.  
    G.OPN -> YM220, respectively.  
      G.OPN -> G.I.M.I.C. module set to YM2203 (Pri/Sec)  
      G.OPNA -> G.I.M.I.C. module set to YM2608 (Pri/Sec)  
    The setting information is sent to the G.I.M.I.C. module set to YM2608(Pri/Sec).  
    Note that the settings are transmitted only when playback starts.  
    Therefore, even if the fader is moved during playback, the value will not be reflected immediately.  
    The initial values are,  
      .muc(mucom88) -> 63 (equivalent to PC-8801-11)  
      .mub(mucom88) -> 63 (equivalent to PC-8801-11)  
      .mnd(MNDRV) -> 31 (Equivalent to PC-9801-86)  
      .s98 -> 31 (Equivalent to PC-9801-86)  
      .vgm -> 31 (PC-9801-86 equivalent)  
    The following is a list of the drivers and files.  
    Adjust the balance for each driver or file as needed,  
    Save the file (right-click on the mixer screen to display the save menu).  
    
    The following performance files can also be set automatically by identifying the tags described in the file (TBD).
    
    .S98 file  
    If the character "8801" is found in the "system" tag, MDPlayer will set "63".  
    If it finds the character "9801", MDPlayer sets "31".  
    If both are found, priority is given to "8801".  
    If not found, it will be set to the value set on the mixer screen.  
    
    .vgm file  
    If the character "8801" is found in the "systemname" or "systemnamej" tag, MDPlayer sets "63".  
    If it finds the character "9801", MDPlayer will set the value to "31".  
    If both are found, priority is given to "8801".  
    If not found, the value will be set to the value set on the mixer screen.  
    
    
  About Frequency  
    The module frequency (master clock of the chip) is set for each file format.  
    The setting values are as follows.  
      .vgm -> Use the value set in the file  
      .s98 -> use the value set in the file  
      .mub(mucom88) -> OPNA:7987200Hz  
      .muc(mucom88) -> OPNA:7987200Hz  
      .nrd(NRTDRV) -> OPM:40000000000Hz  
      .mdx(MXDRV) -> OPM:40000000000Hz  
      .mnd(MNDRV) -> OPM:40000000000Hz OPNA:8000000Hz  
      .mml(PMD) -> OPNA:7987200Hz  
      .m(PMD) -> OPNA:7987200Hz  
      .m2(PMD) -> OPNA:7987200Hz  
      .mz(PMD) -> OPNA:7987200Hz  
      .opi(FMP) -> OPNA:7987200Hz  
      .ovi(FMP) -> OPNA:7987200Hz  
      .ozi(FMP) -> OPNA:7987200Hz

[Practice of synchronization]  
    
  It is not easy to synchronize SCCI/GIMIC (C86ctl) and emulation (abbreviated as EMU below).  
  It depends on the environment, so I do not know what is the right way to do it, but I will introduce the adjustment procedure in my environment.  
      
    First, select the device to be used for audio output from the "Output" tab.  
    The recommended pattern is to select "WasapiOut" and "Share" or "ASIO". 2.  
      
    2. Select a delay time of 50ms or 100ms. Press "OK" once to play a song that uses only EMU, and then press "OK" again.  
    Confirm that the sound is not rough or noisy.  
    (If it does not play back nicely, set the delay time one level higher). 3.  
      
    3. Select SCCI for YM2612 from the "Sound" tab and choose the module you wish to use.  
    SCCI only  
    Check the "Send Wait Signal" and "Emulate PCM only" check boxes.  
    If "Emulate PCM only" is checked, only PCM emulation will be performed.  
    If the "Emulate PCM only" checkbox is not checked, PCM data will be sent to SCCI, but the sound quality and tempo will not be stable.  
    If "Send Wait Signal" is checked, the SCCI tempo seems to stabilize.  
    However, if "Double wait" is checked, the PCM sound quality improves, but the tempo tends to be unstable.  
      
    For the delayed group, set SCCI/GIMIC and EMU to 0 ms, and check the "Wait for Day Mode" checkbox.  
    The "opportunistic mode" is used, for example, when there is a large load during a performance and the SCCI/GIMIC playback and the EMU playback are far apart.  
    This function adjusts the SCCI/GIMIC playback speed to reduce the discrepancy. However, the (intended) misalignment set by delayed playback will be maintained.  
      
    5. Play a song in which both SCCI/GIMIC and EMU are used, and carefully check which one sounds first.  
    Increase the delay time of the one being played first among SCCI/GIMIC and EMU and play back the song to check.  
      
    Repeat steps 6.5 until there is no more discrepancy and the synchronization process is complete. Enjoy!  
      
    7. Regarding the performance gap between SCCI and GIMIC.  
    If SCCI is fast, adjust the delay setting item of SCCI.  
    If GIMIC is too fast, adjust the delay setting item of GIMIC.  
  
  
[Practice of MIDI keyboard]  
  If you have a MIDI keyboard, you can use it to make sounds from YM2612(EMU).  
  This function is mainly intended to support MML typing.  
  (Some functions are currently in the process of being implemented and are not available.)  
  
  How to use for now  
      
    1. select the MIDI keyboard to be used on the setup screen. 2.  
       
    Send (CC:97) during playback of YM2612 data.  
        YM2612's 1Ch voice will be set to all channels. 3.  
       
    3. all you have to do is play.  
    
  Main functions  
      
    1. tone data capture  
      Clicking on the tone data section of each OPN or OPM sound source or keyboard display copies the tone data to the selected channel.  
      The tone data is copied to the selected channel. 2.  
      
    2. performance mode switching  
      MONO mode (single channel playback) and POLY mode (multiple channels playback)  
      POLY mode (play using multiple channels (up to 6 channels)).  
      MONO mode  
      MONO mode: Short phrases are played during recording and output as MML.  
      POLY Mode Assumed to be used to check chords during recording. 3.  
      
    3. channel note log  
      Up to 100 notes can be recorded per channel. 4.  
      
    4. channel note log MML conversion function  
      Clicking on the log field copies the pronunciation record to the clipboard as MML.  
      Note lengths are not output. The corresponding command is c d e f g a b o < >.  
      Octave information is specified absolutely with the o command for the first note only,  
      After that, the octave information is expanded by relative specification using the < command > command. 5.  
      
    5. saving and loading tones  
      It is possible to save or load 256 different tones in memory.  
      The data can be output to or loaded from a file in a specified format.  
      The following software formats can be used for saving and loading.  
        FMP7

[FAQ]  
  
  The system does not start up.  
  
    Case 1  
      An error occurs during startup because a zone identifier has been added to the file.  
    Zone identifiers are one of the protective functions of the OS, and are automatically added to files downloaded from the Internet to prevent unintended file execution.  
    However, if a file is downloaded with the intention of executing it, it will be interfered with as in this case.  
    →Double-click on the file removeZoneIdent.bat to run it.  
    This batch file removes zone identifiers in bulk.  
    The following message will be displayed.  
        Unknown error occurred.  
        Exception Message: Could not load file or assembly.  
        Could not load file or assembly  
        'file://.... .dll' or one of its dependencies,Operation is not supported.  
        (Exception from HRESULT:xxxx)  

    Case2  
      This error mainly occurs when a real chip is used, because SCCI is in a state to use c86ctl.  
    Since MDPlayer also uses c86ctl, they fight each other and fail to start.  
    →Uncheck the "enable" checkbox of the c86ctl setting item using scciconfig.exe.  
  
    Case3.  
      The version of the .NETframework is different.  
    →NETframework.  
    NETframework.  
        Unknown error occurred.  
        Exception Message: Could not load file or assembly.  
        Could not load file or assembly  
        'netstandard, Version=... , Culture=... , PublicKeyToken=...' or one of its dependencies. or one of its dependencies. The specified file cannot be found.    

    CaseX  
      TBD  
  
  
  Tempo is not stable, the beginning of the song is not played at the beginning of the performance, or the song is fast-forwarded.  
  
    Case1  
      This problem mainly occurs when using a real chip. The real chip takes some time for processing at the start of a performance.  
    On the other hand, the emulation chip completes the process immediately at the start of a song.  
    This is because the real chip tries to catch up with the emulation to close the time gap.  
    →In the "Options" screen: "Sound" tab: uncheck the "Hiyori" checkbox in the lower left corner.  
  
    CaseX  
      TBD  
  
  
  The sound is choppy. The display is very heavy.  
  
    Case 1  
    This case occurs when all necessary processing is not completed within a limited time.  
    Open the "Output" tab from the "Options" screen and switch the device.  
    We recommend that you try different devices as it depends on your environment.  
    Wasapi and ASIO often give the best response.  
    Depending on the device, adjusting the "Latency (render buffer)" value may improve the response.  
  
    CaseX  
      TBD  
  
  
  When playing on a real chip, some PCM sounds are not quite right.  

    PCM sound becomes strange when played on real chips, such as PCM playback by YM2612 or SSG, because accurate interrupt processing is not possible.
